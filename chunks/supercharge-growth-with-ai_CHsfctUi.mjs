Right now, there’s no better way to demonstrate that than by having a killer AI strategy.\n\n## Why Investors Want to See AI in Your Strategy\n\nInvestors are seeking startups that use AI, as it demonstrates readiness to grow, adapt, and lead in the market. A study by McKinsey & Company found that companies using AI and data analytics have a 19% better chance of earning profits above the industry average. This underscores the importance of integrating these technologies for a competitive edge. Startups face constant pressure to show efficiency, adaptability, and potential for massive growth. AI ticks all those boxes. By integrating AI into your operations—even in small, targeted ways—you can cut costs, streamline processes, create new partnerships, and open up new revenue channels. Take Bright Machines, for example. They use AI-driven robotics and recently raised $106 million with help from BlackRock and Nvidia. Adopting AI isn’t just a trend; it signals that your startup is ready for significant growth.\n\n## Tackle Real Pain Points with AI\n\nFor a startup, efficiency isn’t a luxury—it’s survival. AI can automate repetitive tasks and improve decision-making based on data, allowing your team to focus on scaling. However, it's important to note that having AI in your company doesn’t guarantee the right decisions. When paired with other growth hacking techniques, AI becomes a key factor and can be utilized across many market sectors.\n\nBecause cloud-based AI tools are more accessible than ever, you don’t need a massive budget to start. Testing AI in phases saves costs and allows you to show quick, clear results. This appeals to investors who are closely watching your progress and burn rate.\n\n## Ready to Drive Growth with AI?\n\nLegacyAI.Cloud helps you modernize outdated systems and add cloud-based AI to your operations.
